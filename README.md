# Deepfake Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution for detecting deepfake videos. We employed three different models: ResNext, DenseNet, and XceptionNet, to train and evaluate their performance in detecting deepfake content. After thorough experimentation, we found ResNeXt to be the most effective model for our task.

## Dataset
We used FaceForensics++ dataset for training the model.

## Model Selection
After training and evaluating the three models mentioned above, we determined that ResNeXt provided the highest accuracy and robustness for deepfake detection. Therefore, we selected ResNeXt as our primary model for further predictions and deployment.

## Prediction with ResNeXt
We used the trained ResNeXt model to make predictions on new data. The model achieved commendable accuracy and demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying deepfake videos.
